# About

LRR Capital is a hedge fund founded by three students in 2020. We currently invest approximately $12,000 in total assets under management.

LRR Capital is registered as a limited liability company (LLC) with the State of Georgia. 

## Strategy 

Our strategy emphasizes traditional value-based long/short positions on public equities, with a focus on mid- and small- cap companies across a variety of industries. We allocate portions of our portfolio to different categories of companies based on financial criteria to balance stability with growth. We use a variety of metrics and ratios to measure our portfolio's performance relative to its risk, volatility, and the overal market's performance.

Each of our founders plays an active role in sourcing and researching investments. Read more about our founders below.
